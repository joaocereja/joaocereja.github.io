                <h2>Day 1 – Hong Kong</h2>
                <p> The 15 hour flight had less negative effects on my body than any other long distance flight I have taken. Probably due to the compression socks my Mom got me for Christmas. My bony butt is usually sore from plane seats, but Cathay Pacific must have some design remedy. No pain!
Security at HKG was a breeze as was getting to the city from the airport. The train station is literally part of the lobby when you exit through customs. Very clean!
I transferred twice to get to the MTR's Tsuen Wan line. My hostel is just a stone's throw away from one of its stations. The MTR is amazing for several reasons that I have picked up so far. First, huge trains with open gangways. There is so much space in these trains so even during rush hour they felt roomy. Second, the headways. So far, the longest I have waited for a train is 4 minutes and that was for the less frequent airport train. There is a lot more to talk about, but the final shoutout I will give is to the systems cross-platform transfer points. They are everywhere and it makes transferring from one line to another super easy.
I arrived at the hostel at 7am, which is on the 7th, 14th, and 15th floor of a sufficiently gritty building, and rang the doorbell to drop my bag off until the 1pm check-in. It obviously awakened the manager, who remembered our email conversation about the early drop-off after I gave my name. She would later tell me at check-in that she was surprised that I was a man which got a chuckle out of both of us. This is pretty common when I travel since Cherry comes first on my passport.
I hopped on the MTR and went straight for Hong Kong Island and Mt Victoria. Walking up the old road to the summit took about an hour or so, and I walked around to several viewpoints of this incredibly photogenic city. Walking around the backside of Mt Victoria led to an unexpected zone of quiet. It was early, maybe 8:30am, and the mountain blocked the noise of Hong Kong'git s economically driven rumblings. I spent a peaceful few minutes staring out at the multitude of cargo vessels, lazily waiting for their turn to berth.
I walked down the mountain and took the train to what's known as the “Monster Building”. It's a collection of high rises that ominously surround a small courtyard and has become a bit of a tourist spot. I immediately felt a bit disgusted with myself as I arrived due to a large sign that discouraged photography and video. The feeling quickly lessened seeing other tourists taking photos and I sheepishly snapped a few ~tasteful~ pics. 
About this time, I started realizing I had made a couple errors due to my lack of research on Hong Kong. First, small shops and street vendors, for the most part, only take payment via Oyster Card (which you use cash to top up if you are without a NFC (tap to pay) phone), cash, or AlipayHK/WeChat PayHK (for which you need a HK phone number). I did not realize that the Alipay/WeChat pay that I created for Mainland China would not work in HK and I also did not realize how long it would take for my $ to transfer over to my new debit card account that I am using for the trip. So no access to cash and no HK apps means I can currently only go to vendors who take credit cards. There are still quite a few of them, maybe 35%, but it shrinks my options. Hopefully this snafu means smooth sailing in Mainland China.
I MTR'd back to my hostel's neighborhood and stumbled into a street market taking place a block down from where I am staying. I walked around, snapping photos, enjoying the sunshine, and even managed to get some lunch close to my lodging.
Checking into my Hostel, I had another learning moment: hostelworld only charges a small amount to book the hostel, but the catch is that you need local currency to pay the rest without incurring a fee. I checked the rest of my bookings and it seems like this is the case for all of them. Good to learn this early and it only cost $1.75 USD for the mistake.
My room the first night was pretty solid. I had a nice view and some windows that opened up from my 15th floor perch. The best part was I had no roommates for the time being and that wouldn't change until 3am the next day. A late night arrival I suppose.
After settling in a little, I hopped on the MTR once again and made my way to Cha Kwo Ling. This is one of Hong Kong's last major informal settlements and it is set to be completely demolished this year. The aluminum sidings and tarped entryways evoked a different time for Hong Kong, perhaps before the construction of the first high rises that now dominate the entire SAR. Signs were posted on most houses announcing their impending demolition and that the property needs to be vacated. I passed by a well known eatery that, to my surprise, was still running. If only I had some cash! I might have to stop by if I have time while staying in Shenzhen. 
The community of Cha Kwo Ling has remained resilient in the face of change for hundreds of years and was a village before the British took control of Hong Kong Island in 1841. I was glad to be able to walk its paths before they are gone.
I made it back to my hostel, got some food (some delicious wonton soup) and went to sleep at a very early 5:30pm. I then woke up at 9:30pm and got some dinner (fish, beef sauce, and rice, with boba). The jetlag was strong on day 1 and it ended with me wide awake working on my thesis…

                <h2>Day 2 – Hong Kong</h2>
                <p> My circadian rhythm struggled the first night in Hong Kong. My wake-up time was about 12 a.m., and I hung out in bed for another 4-5 hours before heading outside. However, I knew things would improve over time, so I optimistically saw this first week or so of weird sleep schedules as an opportunity to explore the city in the early morning. I walked from my hostel up Argyle Street, watching the drivers of the minibuses—20-seaters that run most hours of the day and are extremely inexpensive to ride—preparing for their days. A few elderly people were already walking around, swinging their arms and mashing their hands together in what seems to be a pretty popular form of exercise in HK. The intimidating high-rises coupled with the city lights made for some nice twilight photography.
My morning destination was Kowloon Walled City Park, which sits on the site of the historic Kowloon Walled City (KWC). If you have not heard of KWC, I highly recommend looking it up. It is the poster child for the dystopian cyberpunk aesthetic, and films like Akira and Ghost in the Shell seem to have been inspired by KWC's complex of apartments, businesses, and Triad operations. The population of the 6-acre settlement probably peaked at 50,000 in the 1980s. KWC was demolished in the early 1990s, and the aforementioned park contains a historic site, traditional gardens, green space, a pond, and sports facilities. The government has kept the remnants of the original south gate and its entry sign, memorializing the distinct neighborhood that had been present in Hong Kong since 1898.
I searched around for a restaurant near the park and was lucky to find one that had just opened up. A pot of tea, sweet dumplings, and cheung fun (rice noodle rolls). The chef/owner was kind enough to show me which sauce was best to be poured over the rolls. 10/10 good food and vibes. I was also very hungry, so that helped make it taste even better.
I walked back to the hostel and packed up all my gear. I was told I was getting a new room for the second night (foreshadowing), so I left my pack at the hostel office for the day. When I got to the office, I had the pleasure of meeting the hostel cat. Another 10/10 experience, no notes.
I left the hostel and took the MTR to the end of the Tsuen Wan Line. From the station, I walked and hiked up to not quite the top of the highest point of Hong Kong: Tai Mo Shan. HK is a very mountainous peninsula, and the relief between the highest point and the ocean is 3,140 feet, so from the train station to the summit was about 3,000 feet of climbing.
I just followed the Google Maps route that, for the most part, did a good job leading me to the summit, with a couple caveats. I walked up the road to a pedestrian overpass that led to some concrete stairs. Stairs would be abundant during this trek, especially during the early stages, which routed through little neighborhoods on the mountainside. After a few stairs and streets, I got to a less well-maintained set of stairs next to a Buddhist temple. I followed the stairs and came across my first obstacle: a rusty bridge with holes in it. I crossed the bridge like an idiot, trusting in the HK municipal workers who probably had not done maintenance there in decades. As the stairs climbed through the mountainside, the trees became denser and the city noises began to subside. Then a sign that I could not read was made in a makeshift fashion sitting by the trail. I whipped out trusty old Google Translate. The Cantonese translation was “there are dogs.” I kept walking, and sure enough I heard barking along with some peculiar noises. What I had come across seemed to be HK’s version of the sovereign citizen. The settlement had barbed wire on top of aluminum siding turned fencing, several “no trespassing” signs, and a noisemaker that emanated gunshot-like sounds. Luckily, the dogs were behind the fence and the trail continued on past the refuge. Whoever lives there does not want visitors: another sign they had purportedly created further up the trail translated to, “there is evil under the mountain.”
More steps led to a road where I saw my first of many elder groups taking a guided walk. Either they came up a different route, or the HK olds are in serious shape!
On the next set of stairs, I heard some rustling in the bushes, which sounded larger than the birds I had heard earlier on the trail. What I saw was the coolest animal I have seen in a while: a tiny deer called a red muntjac! I did not get a picture, but look this one up. It is a super interesting little critter.
The final phase of the hike wound on a road and then a trail through a large cemetery and then up the open south face of the mountain. The biome changed at this point to a savannah ecosystem, and I started to see more hikers. It turns out there was a trail race going on that was routed along one of the roads that led to the summit. I stopped at the fire tower at the first big lookout point before heading to the top—well, sort of the top. The last 200 feet or so are blocked off by the PRC's aviation division, and I declined to try to bushwhack along the fence line. All the day's sketchy moments, and it was the CHINESE GOVERNMENT that stopped me from going further.
I descended down an easier and shorter path and was truly tired out when I got to the bus stop on Route Twisk (I thought this was an interesting name). My longest wait for public transportation thus far was about 12 minutes, and it was waiting for a double-decker bus on a mountain road, 9 straight-line miles from downtown HK. Bus 81 took me back to Tsuen Wan Station, where I realized how hungry I was. After failing to track down a restaurant or food stall that accepted a Visa card, I ended up buying a sandwich from 7/11. Riveting stuff. When I revisit HK, I will be sure to be more prepared money-wise, although by then I am sure the problem I am having won't exist.
I took the MTR back to my hostel and awaited my destiny: a new hostel room had been chosen by the manager, and it was a doozy! Cramped, bathroom full of rust and for sure some mold, a nice musty cigarette smell, and virtually no windows. My airy, virtually one-person loft of day one was no more. Reality was restored. I was able to chat with a Japanese guy who was ostensibly in HK to gamble to his heart's content.
I decided to get out of there quickly and also try to stay up as late as possible to stave off another early wake-up. I walked down to Temple Street to check out the market. It was full of pop-up shops, food vendors, sex workers, and street lanterns. While I had read about how this was a tourist spot, I thoroughly enjoyed it nonetheless. I grabbed some food from a restaurant with an outdoor cooking space, a nice way to end my time in HK. I was awakened in the night by some shouting and screaming coming from another room in the hostel, but it was not enough to fully deter me from my slumber. Good night!
