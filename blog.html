                <h2>Day 1 – Hong Kong</h2>
                <p> The 15 hour flight had less negative effects on my body than any other long distance flight I have taken. Probably due to the compression socks my Mom got me for Christmas. My bony butt is usually sore from plane seats, but Cathay Pacific must have some design remedy. No pain!
Security at HKG was a breeze as was getting to the city from the airport. The train station is literally part of the lobby when you exit through customs. Very clean!
I transferred twice to get to the MTR's Tsuen Wan line. My hostel is just a stone's throw away from one of its stations. The MTR is amazing for several reasons that I have picked up so far. First, huge trains with open gangways. There is so much space in these trains so even during rush hour they felt roomy. Second, the headways. So far, the longest I have waited for a train is 4 minutes and that was for the less frequent airport train. There is a lot more to talk about, but the final shoutout I will give is to the systems cross-platform transfer points. They are everywhere and it makes transferring from one line to another super easy.
I arrived at the hostel at 7am, which is on the 7th, 14th, and 15th floor of a sufficiently gritty building, and rang the doorbell to drop my bag off until the 1pm check-in. It obviously awakened the manager, who remembered our email conversation about the early drop-off after I gave my name. She would later tell me at check-in that she was surprised that I was a man which got a chuckle out of both of us. This is pretty common when I travel since Cherry comes first on my passport.
I hopped on the MTR and went straight for Hong Kong Island and Mt Victoria. Walking up the old road to the summit took about an hour or so, and I walked around to several viewpoints of this incredibly photogenic city. Walking around the backside of Mt Victoria led to an unexpected zone of quiet. It was early, maybe 8:30am, and the mountain blocked the noise of Hong Kong'git s economically driven rumblings. I spent a peaceful few minutes staring out at the multitude of cargo vessels, lazily waiting for their turn to berth.
I walked down the mountain and took the train to what's known as the “Monster Building”. It's a collection of high rises that ominously surround a small courtyard and has become a bit of a tourist spot. I immediately felt a bit disgusted with myself as I arrived due to a large sign that discouraged photography and video. The feeling quickly lessened seeing other tourists taking photos and I sheepishly snapped a few ~tasteful~ pics. 
About this time, I started realizing I had made a couple errors due to my lack of research on Hong Kong. First, small shops and street vendors, for the most part, only take payment via Oyster Card (which you use cash to top up if you are without a NFC (tap to pay) phone), cash, or AlipayHK/WeChat PayHK (for which you need a HK phone number). I did not realize that the Alipay/WeChat pay that I created for Mainland China would not work in HK and I also did not realize how long it would take for my $ to transfer over to my new debit card account that I am using for the trip. So no access to cash and no HK apps means I can currently only go to vendors who take credit cards. There are still quite a few of them, maybe 35%, but it shrinks my options. Hopefully this snafu means smooth sailing in Mainland China.
I MTR'd back to my hostel's neighborhood and stumbled into a street market taking place a block down from where I am staying. I walked around, snapping photos, enjoying the sunshine, and even managed to get some lunch close to my lodging.
Checking into my Hostel, I had another learning moment: hostelworld only charges a small amount to book the hostel, but the catch is that you need local currency to pay the rest without incurring a fee. I checked the rest of my bookings and it seems like this is the case for all of them. Good to learn this early and it only cost $1.75 USD for the mistake.
My room the first night was pretty solid. I had a nice view and some windows that opened up from my 15th floor perch. The best part was I had no roommates for the time being and that wouldn't change until 3am the next day. A late night arrival I suppose.
After settling in a little, I hopped on the MTR once again and made my way to Cha Kwo Ling. This is one of Hong Kong's last major informal settlements and it is set to be completely demolished this year. The aluminum sidings and tarped entryways evoked a different time for Hong Kong, perhaps before the construction of the first high rises that now dominate the entire SAR. Signs were posted on most houses announcing their impending demolition and that the property needs to be vacated. I passed by a well known eatery that, to my surprise, was still running. If only I had some cash! I might have to stop by if I have time while staying in Shenzhen. 
The community of Cha Kwo Ling has remained resilient in the face of change for hundreds of years and was a village before the British took control of Hong Kong Island in 1841. I was glad to be able to walk its paths before they are gone.
I made it back to my hostel, got some food (some delicious wonton soup) and went to sleep at a very early 5:30pm. I then woke up at 9:30pm and got some dinner (fish, beef sauce, and rice, with boba). The jetlag was strong on day 1 and it ended with me wide awake working on my thesis…
