            <p>Short daily updates from my travels. I guess these aren't very short after all.</p>

            <section id="day1">
                <h2>Day 1 – Hong Kong</h2>
                <p> The 15 hour flight had less negative effects on my body than any other long distance flight I have taken. Probably due to the compression socks my Mom got me for Christmas. My bony butt is usually sore from plane seats, but Cathay Pacific must have some design remedy. No pain!
Security at HKG was a breeze as was getting to the city from the airport. The train station is literally part of the lobby when you exit through customs. Very clean!
I transferred twice to get to the MTR's Tsuen Wan line. My hostel is just a stone's throw away from one of its stations. The MTR is amazing for several reasons that I have picked up so far. First, huge trains with open gangways. There is so much space in these trains so even during rush hour they felt roomy. Second, the headways. So far, the longest I have waited for a train is 4 minutes and that was for the less frequent airport train. There is a lot more to talk about, but the final shoutout I will give is to the systems cross-platform transfer points. They are everywhere and it makes transferring from one line to another super easy.
I arrived at the hostel at 7am, which is on the 7th, 14th, and 15th floor of a sufficiently gritty building, and rang the doorbell to drop my bag off until the 1pm check-in. It obviously awakened the manager, who remembered our email conversation about the early drop-off after I gave my name. She would later tell me at check-in that she was surprised that I was a man which got a chuckle out of both of us. This is pretty common when I travel since Cherry comes first on my passport.
I hopped on the MTR and went straight for Hong Kong Island and Mt Victoria. Walking up the old road to the summit took about an hour or so, and I walked around to several viewpoints of this incredibly photogenic city. Walking around the backside of Mt Victoria led to an unexpected zone of quiet. It was early, maybe 8:30am, and the mountain blocked the noise of Hong Kong'git s economically driven rumblings. I spent a peaceful few minutes staring out at the multitude of cargo vessels, lazily waiting for their turn to berth.
I walked down the mountain and took the train to what's known as the “Monster Building”. It's a collection of high rises that ominously surround a small courtyard and has become a bit of a tourist spot. I immediately felt a bit disgusted with myself as I arrived due to a large sign that discouraged photography and video. The feeling quickly lessened seeing other tourists taking photos and I sheepishly snapped a few ~tasteful~ pics. 
About this time, I started realizing I had made a couple errors due to my lack of research on Hong Kong. First, small shops and street vendors, for the most part, only take payment via Oyster Card (which you use cash to top up if you are without a NFC (tap to pay) phone), cash, or AlipayHK/WeChat PayHK (for which you need a HK phone number). I did not realize that the Alipay/WeChat pay that I created for Mainland China would not work in HK and I also did not realize how long it would take for my $ to transfer over to my new debit card account that I am using for the trip. So no access to cash and no HK apps means I can currently only go to vendors who take credit cards. There are still quite a few of them, maybe 35%, but it shrinks my options. Hopefully this snafu means smooth sailing in Mainland China.
I MTR'd back to my hostel's neighborhood and stumbled into a street market taking place a block down from where I am staying. I walked around, snapping photos, enjoying the sunshine, and even managed to get some lunch close to my lodging.
Checking into my Hostel, I had another learning moment: hostelworld only charges a small amount to book the hostel, but the catch is that you need local currency to pay the rest without incurring a fee. I checked the rest of my bookings and it seems like this is the case for all of them. Good to learn this early and it only cost $1.75 USD for the mistake.
My room the first night was pretty solid. I had a nice view and some windows that opened up from my 15th floor perch. The best part was I had no roommates for the time being and that wouldn't change until 3am the next day. A late night arrival I suppose.
After settling in a little, I hopped on the MTR once again and made my way to Cha Kwo Ling. This is one of Hong Kong's last major informal settlements and it is set to be completely demolished this year. The aluminum sidings and tarped entryways evoked a different time for Hong Kong, perhaps before the construction of the first high rises that now dominate the entire SAR. Signs were posted on most houses announcing their impending demolition and that the property needs to be vacated. I passed by a well known eatery that, to my surprise, was still running. If only I had some cash! I might have to stop by if I have time while staying in Shenzhen. 
The community of Cha Kwo Ling has remained resilient in the face of change for hundreds of years and was a village before the British took control of Hong Kong Island in 1841. I was glad to be able to walk its paths before they are gone.
I made it back to my hostel, got some food (some delicious wonton soup) and went to sleep at a very early 5:30pm. I then woke up at 9:30pm and got some dinner (fish, beef sauce, and rice, with boba). The jetlag was strong on day 1 and it ended with me wide awake working on my thesis…

                <h2>Day 2 – Hong Kong</h2>
                <p> My circadian rhythm struggled the first night in Hong Kong. My wake-up time was about 12 a.m., and I hung out in bed for another 4-5 hours before heading outside. However, I knew things would improve over time, so I optimistically saw this first week or so of weird sleep schedules as an opportunity to explore the city in the early morning. I walked from my hostel up Argyle Street, watching the drivers of the minibuses—20-seaters that run most hours of the day and are extremely inexpensive to ride—preparing for their days. A few elderly people were already walking around, swinging their arms and mashing their hands together in what seems to be a pretty popular form of exercise in HK. The intimidating high-rises coupled with the city lights made for some nice twilight photography.
My morning destination was Kowloon Walled City Park, which sits on the site of the historic Kowloon Walled City (KWC). If you have not heard of KWC, I highly recommend looking it up. It is the poster child for the dystopian cyberpunk aesthetic, and films like Akira and Ghost in the Shell seem to have been inspired by KWC's complex of apartments, businesses, and Triad operations. The population of the 6-acre settlement probably peaked at 50,000 in the 1980s. KWC was demolished in the early 1990s, and the aforementioned park contains a historic site, traditional gardens, green space, a pond, and sports facilities. The government has kept the remnants of the original south gate and its entry sign, memorializing the distinct neighborhood that had been present in Hong Kong since 1898.
I searched around for a restaurant near the park and was lucky to find one that had just opened up. A pot of tea, sweet dumplings, and cheung fun (rice noodle rolls). The chef/owner was kind enough to show me which sauce was best to be poured over the rolls. 10/10 good food and vibes. I was also very hungry, so that helped make it taste even better.
I walked back to the hostel and packed up all my gear. I was told I was getting a new room for the second night (foreshadowing), so I left my pack at the hostel office for the day. When I got to the office, I had the pleasure of meeting the hostel cat. Another 10/10 experience, no notes.
I left the hostel and took the MTR to the end of the Tsuen Wan Line. From the station, I walked and hiked up to not quite the top of the highest point of Hong Kong: Tai Mo Shan. HK is a very mountainous peninsula, and the relief between the highest point and the ocean is 3,140 feet, so from the train station to the summit was about 3,000 feet of climbing.
I just followed the Google Maps route that, for the most part, did a good job leading me to the summit, with a couple caveats. I walked up the road to a pedestrian overpass that led to some concrete stairs. Stairs would be abundant during this trek, especially during the early stages, which routed through little neighborhoods on the mountainside. After a few stairs and streets, I got to a less well-maintained set of stairs next to a Buddhist temple. I followed the stairs and came across my first obstacle: a rusty bridge with holes in it. I crossed the bridge like an idiot, trusting in the HK municipal workers who probably had not done maintenance there in decades. As the stairs climbed through the mountainside, the trees became denser and the city noises began to subside. Then a sign that I could not read was made in a makeshift fashion sitting by the trail. I whipped out trusty old Google Translate. The Cantonese translation was “there are dogs.” I kept walking, and sure enough I heard barking along with some peculiar noises. What I had come across seemed to be HK’s version of the sovereign citizen. The settlement had barbed wire on top of aluminum siding turned fencing, several “no trespassing” signs, and a noisemaker that emanated gunshot-like sounds. Luckily, the dogs were behind the fence and the trail continued on past the refuge. Whoever lives there does not want visitors: another sign they had purportedly created further up the trail translated to, “there is evil under the mountain.”
More steps led to a road where I saw my first of many elder groups taking a guided walk. Either they came up a different route, or the HK olds are in serious shape!
On the next set of stairs, I heard some rustling in the bushes, which sounded larger than the birds I had heard earlier on the trail. What I saw was the coolest animal I have seen in a while: a tiny deer called a red muntjac! I did not get a picture, but look this one up. It is a super interesting little critter.
The final phase of the hike wound on a road and then a trail through a large cemetery and then up the open south face of the mountain. The biome changed at this point to a savannah ecosystem, and I started to see more hikers. It turns out there was a trail race going on that was routed along one of the roads that led to the summit. I stopped at the fire tower at the first big lookout point before heading to the top—well, sort of the top. The last 200 feet or so are blocked off by the PRC's aviation division, and I declined to try to bushwhack along the fence line. All the day's sketchy moments, and it was the CHINESE GOVERNMENT that stopped me from going further.
I descended down an easier and shorter path and was truly tired out when I got to the bus stop on Route Twisk (I thought this was an interesting name). My longest wait for public transportation thus far was about 12 minutes, and it was waiting for a double-decker bus on a mountain road, 9 straight-line miles from downtown HK. Bus 81 took me back to Tsuen Wan Station, where I realized how hungry I was. After failing to track down a restaurant or food stall that accepted a Visa card, I ended up buying a sandwich from 7/11. Riveting stuff. When I revisit HK, I will be sure to be more prepared money-wise, although by then I am sure the problem I am having won't exist.
I took the MTR back to my hostel and awaited my destiny: a new hostel room had been chosen by the manager, and it was a doozy! Cramped, bathroom full of rust and for sure some mold, a nice musty cigarette smell, and virtually no windows. My airy, virtually one-person loft of day one was no more. Reality was restored. I was able to chat with a Japanese guy who was ostensibly in HK to gamble to his heart's content.
I decided to get out of there quickly and also try to stay up as late as possible to stave off another early wake-up. I walked down to Temple Street to check out the market. It was full of pop-up shops, food vendors, sex workers, and street lanterns. While I had read about how this was a tourist spot, I thoroughly enjoyed it nonetheless. I grabbed some food from a restaurant with an outdoor cooking space, a nice way to end my time in HK. I was awakened in the night by some shouting and screaming coming from another room in the hostel, but it was not enough to fully deter me from my slumber. Good night!

                <h2>Day 3 – Hong Kong and Shenzhen</h2>
                <p> It was another early wake-up, but improvement was made: 2am this time! I hung out in bed for a few hours before heading out once again to view the streets before the city fully awakened. My legs were a bit sore from the day prior, so I cut my exploration short and decided to head back to my room to get some work done before finding a breakfast spot.
I had an area just north of me in mind; Anthony Bourdain had stopped by a couple shops in this neighborhood during his HK episode of Parts Unknown. I walked towards one of the places that had been featured and stopped at a little place that had been featured in the Michelin star guide book in 2013. It was a small shop that served classic Cantonese fare, and I also saw they had a card reader at the host station. I asked the woman at the front of the shop whether they took Visa and showed her my card, and she gestured for me to sit down, nodding her head. This is unfortunately where the conversation was lost in translation. After eating a succulent Cantonese meal (nice reference), I got up to pay and, to my embarrassment, she said they would not take Visa. This probably frustrated the worker to no end. I tried using WeChat Pay, which I knew would not work, and pointed to the option on the reader to use a credit card. Their subscription must not have included the use of credit cards; I am not totally sure. In the end, the worker who had greeted me at the beginning brought out a 100 HKD (the bill was 58 HKD) note and basically said it was on the house. Bad foreigner moment. I'll have to go back again and repay them… In the end, mistakes happen, and I was lucky enough to have benefited from a nice shop owner willing to give me a pass.
I walked back to the hostel to pack up my belongings, feeling a bit dejected about my bad foreigner moment. I said goodbye to my roommates and dropped my bag at the check-in desk for storage. One more HK adventure before I cross to mainland China.
If my spirits were down from the restaurant incident, they were quickly lifted by taking a double decker bus to Monkey Mountain (Kam Shan). They aren't kidding, there are monkeys everywhere, specifically Rhesus macaques. Kam Shan Park contains forest, lots of BBQ picnic zones, and three reservoirs. I spent about an hour strolling around on what was a beautiful, sunny day. This is a nice little adventure for those wanting to visit a park or natural area in HK, but don't want to do anything too strenuous.
Transportation time! I took the bus back to my hostel, grabbed my bags, and walked to Mong Kok East station. Here I would take the East Rail Line to Lo Wu station, where I would then walk across the border to mainland China, the Big PRC.
For those asking “why would you have to cross the border from China into China”, the answer lies in Hong Kong's colonial history. HK was leased from China by the UK from 1898 to 1997, and when the “handover” happened in 1997, HK was made a special administrative region of China. This allowed HK to keep its system of government largely separated from the PRC's in what is called “one country, two systems”. One of the policies that differentiates HK from the People's Republic of China (PRC) is its immigration policies. HK has a much more relaxed policy regarding both temporary and permanent visas. Additionally, HK allows visa-free tourist access to far more countries than the PRC.
Speaking of visas, my train arrived at Lo Wu terminus station, and I walked through HK exit immigration to PRC immigration and customs. I won't lie, PRC immigration is intimidating. There are tons of cameras, lots of stern-looking guards and immigration personnel, and the amount of English present drops off dramatically once you cross the HK-PRC line. I was nervous but still a bit giddy about the whole situation. I went to the wrong line at first and was told to go upstairs to a different line. Then I got in the correct line but was told I needed to fill out a form to cross the border. I filled out the online form and got back in line. The immigration officer checked my passport and visa, asked me a few questions, and had my fingerprints scanned. Then I was all set! I realized it really was not much different than a US border, and thinking about it, the US officers are usually way pushier than the ones I encountered at the PRC border, and I'm a US citizen!
I walked out of the station to the Shenzhen sunshine. My visa had worked and I was on to new destinations. I snapped some photos of the famous Luohu Port and then walked down to the subway. It was only a couple stops before I arrived at the station closest to my hostel. My first “Wow!” moment came upon exiting the station and walking up the stairs to the street. In front of me was a sea of cars, mopeds, delivery bikes, and pedestrians, but it was somehow quiet??? How was the street noise so weirdly subdued with so much traffic? The answer is electric vehicles. Almost all of the bikes and mopeds are electric, and my own quick ocular survey saw maybe 8 in 10 cars and trucks—yes, even trucks—were electric. Are the streets still chaotic? Yes, mopeds fly past you on the street and sidewalk with seemingly zero enforcement. Yet, I was impressed, and the scenes made me think about what the streets must have been like before the adoption of electric vehicles and mopeds.
I followed Amap's (map app used in China because Google Maps is not functional) directions to a high-rise building about a 5-minute walk from the subway station. It was a little difficult finding the entrance to the elevator lobby, but once I did, I went up to the 26th floor and then the 7th, as I remembered that the men's hostel room was on the 7th floor and women's was on the 26th. In room 719, I met the hostel owner, a really lively guy who spoke some English. He energetically showed me where all the trappings of the hostel were, and we chatted a little about the United States and China. A big moment was when we exchanged WeChat numbers, my first WeChat friend!
I set up in the hostel and then went to the famous shopping area of Shenzhen's Luohu district. The area is called Dongmen, and it has been a market neighborhood for about 300 years. It is also famously the site of the first McDonald's on mainland China, which was established in 1990. I did not get McDonald's, if you were wondering. There was, however, some really cool street food happening in one of the alleys, and though I did not get food at that moment, I knew I had to come back another night.
I was nervous about ordering food in mainland China at first. I was not sure what the process would be like and felt like I was burdening the workers and shopkeepers. This is what kept me from ordering the street food at first. Luckily, I found out that it was pretty easy to order food in China, and at many restaurants you hardly need to interact with anyone. The process at a lot of places is to sit down and use the QR code on the table to order and pay using Alipay or WeChat Pay. Food is brought to you, then you eat and leave. No wait staff, no tipping, just pure efficiency. I have always been a fan of the lack of American-style waitstaff in most other countries, especially those in what is considered the “global south”. I understand why the American restaurant experience is the way it is—the customer comes first and the wait staff has to work for tips—but I find it so much more relaxing to order my food and eat in peace.
My final adventure for the day was taking the train to Lychee Park, which lies on the border of the Luohu and Futian districts of Shenzhen. The park is beautifully maintained and was full of activity the night I walked around. Families were all over the playgrounds and greens, elders and young couples sat next to the lake in the middle of the park, and above all the quaint footpaths and palm trees loomed the massive, postmodern skyscrapers of Shenzhen's financial district, their logos reflecting in the lake. Dusk set in and bats and birds flitted about the park. It was almost dystopian how manicured and lovely everything was. I enjoyed my walk and took some great photos, but I knew I had to find a foil to this neighborhood. I planned a little for the next day and went to bed, way too early, unfortunately.

            <section id="day4">
                <h2>Day 4 – Shenzhen</h2>
                <p> I woke up and checked my phone for the time, expecting it to be about 1 or 2 in the morning. Lo and behold it was almost 6am! I had slept in.
 Still a bit apprehensive about ordering food in China, I walked around a bit looking for something to eat for breakfast. I ended up choosing a corner spot called Yang Mama due to the ease of purchasing food (sit-down order with Alipay on my phone). I ordered 2 big lamb dumplings, 2 pieces of bread, and a rice porridge that I saw other people eating. It cost about $3 and was honestly more than enough food for what I thought was going to be a light breakfast. I enjoyed watching patrons quickly come and go from the restaurant, either picking up or sitting in. From my table I could watch the workers in the kitchen furiously making dumplings to add to the massive pile of dumplings already assembled.
 After breakfast I ventured to the Futian Mangrove Ecology Park. I had read about this park online and took the subway over from my hostel. I was curious about how nature preserves worked in the PRC and upon arriving was not disappointed. The interactive part of the park was full of people, mostly elders taking care of children, enjoying the unseasonably warm weather (mid-70s F, the average is just above 60). The park boasts a large education center, abundant interpretation signs, a bird-watching blind, and sculptures of the pride of the wetlands: the Black-faced Spoonbill. I appreciated the huge amount of information available in the park along with the impressive gains in habitat restoration. Unfortunately, the more undisturbed mangrove area of the park was off-limits the day I went, so I missed out on the observatory deck overlooking the mangroves. The park was not without a little character: at the entrance, a man wearing a Douli was selling two large turtles he had caught and killed.
 After the Park exploration, I took a long metro ride to the very north of Shenzhen to visit the neighborhood of Shajing. The community has a history of 2500 years and several historical sites I visited in Shajing were almost 1000 years old, specifically the Longjin Stone Pagoda. Many of the houses are 300 years old. What was interesting to see was how the neighborhood was being revitalized after years of government neglect. Main paths along the community's spillway had been repaved with stone tiles and the spillway itself is now a stream with clean-looking water running through it. The neighborhood is obviously on the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum. There are lots of signs posted about illegal renting to people without residential identification. In China, where you can live is determined by where you were born in China. The system is called Hukou and it impacts rural people trying to move to cities the most. For many rural people, it is difficult to get their registration changed to allow them to rent in a metropolitan area, usually due to a lack of education and employment in the city where they’d like to move. Instead many rural people illegally rent in poorer neighborhoods in the city and start small businesses. In Shajing, small businesses were everywhere on the high street, especially electric bikes and scooter shops. I learned from a few Chinese residents I talked to that electric scooters are very affordable: $200 USD on the lower end, hence their proliferation. It was fascinating to see a part of Shenzhen that was both being revitalized by the government while still holding fast to the informality for which many outer neighborhoods of cities survive.
 On this day, I spent a good 3 hours on the Shenzhen metro and I started to understand the pros and cons of the PRC's building and design techniques. The subway cars are large, they move quickly, and are very frequent. The metro coverage is extensive and covers most of Shenzhen, which itself is a large city both population and area-wise (771 square miles). The signage and accessibility also seems well done, with elevators proliferating every station. I'll praise Alipay again because it makes riding the metro very easy for a foreigner. You can use a QR code within Alipay to scan at the fare gate and the fare is charged right to your credit or debit card. No need to buy a fare card, use cash to top it up, and constantly use the fare kiosks to check how much money is on your card. Finally, every station has platform screen doors to further enhance safety while waiting for the train. Let’s get to the cons and I’ll begin by saying that one relates to the elevators, because you absolutely need them, even if you are able-bodied: the stations on the metro are too big. They are cavernous, gigantic, almost incomprehensible. If you are lucky, your transfer between trains is cross-platform or one stair level. If you are unlucky, your transfer may be a 10-minute walk up stairs, through halls, through shopping stalls, all underground. The other con is security. Yes, you have to put your bag through an X-ray scanner to get to the fare gates. I understand why they do it, but it’s cumbersome and to be honest it does not seem like the people working the scanner are taking it seriously half the time. Station design and security notwithstanding, I do enjoy the metro in Shenzhen. It got me where I wanted to go and was incredibly affordable ($0.50-$1 for a shorter trip, $1-$2.50 for a longer trip).
 I took the aforementioned metro back to the Luohu district and desperately needed food. I mustered up the courage to go to a small shop a few blocks from my hostel and ordered using the pointing at things on the menu and saying 谢谢. The food was delicious: noodles and some dumplings on the side.
 I ventured back to my hostel and meant to do some writing and research, which I did for about an hour. The long day of walking, learning, and metro riding had made me too sleepy and jetlag grasped ahold of my eyelids once again. I fell asleep at 6pm!
 I was awakened by loud talking in Chinese. I thought, “C'mon guys!” Why are we being loud with the lights on so late. Then I realized the talking was directed at me! My bunk mate, who had arrived later in the night, was telling me to do something. I grabbed my phone, seeing it was almost midnight, and got out Google Translate. He was telling me to wash my feet because they smelled! Now I have been known to be a stinky guy sometimes, so I believed him, until I smelled my socks. They did not smell bad at all, good even! But I conversed with him on Translate and he was insistent and I did not want to cause unneeded animosity. So I washed my feet and went back to bed. Then he asked if I took a shower. In Translate I told him I had washed my feet, as instructed. He said I also needed to take a shower. I obliged, but as retribution asked him a bunch of questions about China via Translate for 10 minutes before taking my shower. Unfortunately, I was now awake and really only slept an hour after showering. I later talked to the hostel manager about this incident and he said the man was probably “depressed”. He had asked the manager to do a bunch of weird stuff as well, like take everyone’s shoes out of the hostel room and leave them in the hall for the night. It was a strange incident, but I felt better knowing it was not my smell that had driven this man to act in this manner.</p>

                <h2>Day 5 – Shenzhen</h2>
                <p>I decided to have a relaxed day to limit physical activity and go to bed at a later time to end my jet lag after not getting a ton of sleep the previous night. I started the day taking a short walk to the KK100 building, which at 1,450 feet tall is the 14th tallest building in the world, but only the second tallest in Shenzhen.
Using the little washing machine in the bathroom, I did my first load of laundry on the trip, and hung-dried my clothes in the building stairwell, which had some nice sun and a slight draft to mix with the faint cigarette smell.
 I took a local bus to the Nanshan district of Shenzhen to check out what's been called the Silicon Valley of China. Tech giants like Tencent, Huawei, and BYD's towering buildings reside in the district, intermingling with the campus of Shenzhen University. Like other areas of Shenzhen, the skyline is extremely post-modern looking without a true trend in architecture and design. I grabbed some spicy noodles at a shop near Shenzhen University and listened to Chinese tech bros converse while slurping their food loudly. Chinese workers have crazy long hours, sometimes 10–12 hours, 6 days a week. At least the sun was out and the weather was warm for their lunch reprieve.
I took the train back to my neighborhood, Luohu, and spent some time talking with the hostel manager. We talked about traveling and how he planned on taking a motorcycle road trip in the spring from Shenzhen to his hometown, Dalian. We laughed about President Trump and ineffective Chinese policies. I also got to meet his daughter, who is about 3 years old. The guy seems like a great Dad, and it was a treat to get to know him a little.
At dinner-time, I ventured back to Dongmen determined to try some of the street food I had refrained from trying during my first visit to the market. After getting turned around in the expansive commercial area, I was able to again find the street food zone. I got a bunch of dumplings from one vendor: one was filled with purple sweet potato paste, another with green veggies, and the last few with some orange mashed root I found interesting-looking. I was lucky enough to nab a noodle dish from a guy who closed his station only a couple patrons after me. All the food was excellent, and the experience gave me confidence to order more street foods and at smaller shops. Dongmen was a great way to finish my time in Shenzhen.
I wanted to break down my final thoughts on Shenzhen and the metro system in comparison to Hong Kong. The cities are so close to one another, so it was cool to see the differences between them. Hong Kong is an awesome city with iconic views, beautiful historical sights, and way more nature than you'd ever expect. I thought the scenery and the nature was honestly the best part of Hong Kong for me. I wish I had been more diligent in my Hong Kong research and had brought cash for this part of the trip. While I definitely got some great food in HK, quite a few of the spontaneous food moments that would have happened were relinquished due to the need for cash. This is one part of China that really shines for me: the versatility of its payment apps and the cashlessness of society. I am the type of guy who doesn't use cash unless I absolutely need to in the US (my barber, for example, who only takes cash). So it's a cashless personal preference that makes Alipay and WeChat Pay so ideal for me. As of writing this, I have purchased something with yuan once. Shenzhen does not have as much going for it compared to HK. It's a newer city without the same architectural and natural beauty, but I think that's partially what makes it interesting. It's a working city that isn't as much of a tourist destination, and visiting some of the less-visited neighborhoods was a great way to peer into Chinese life at different socioeconomic levels. I also found it interesting that the informal settlements of Cha Kwo Ling were being torn down while the dilapidated neighborhood of Shajing was being repaired to attract tourism interest. The architecture and historical relics of Shajing must have something to do with the latter decision.
As for metro systems, it's safe to say the MTR in HK is one of the best systems in the world. Cross-platform transfers everywhere, accessible platforms, platform screen doors, and incredible signage. While not part of the MTR, the bus system in HK is also amazing, with double-decker, single-level, and minibuses covering all the nooks and crannies of the mountainous peninsula. When I go back to HK, I will need to ride the minibus and the double-decker tram, two activities I missed out on this time.
Shenzhen's metro system has fewer cross-platform transfers, sometimes massive transfer walks that make the system inaccessible, but the system shines in its coverage, price (far cheaper than the MTR), and ease of payment (Alipay, WeChat, Tong Card, cash). Plus, bathrooms at every station! The full electrification of the bus system in Shenzhen also makes for less polluted, quieter streets compared to HK's.
It was great to ride both of these systems, and I am looking forward to checking out the public transit throughout China as my journey continues.</p>

                <h2>Day 6 – Guangzhou</h2>
                <p>I woke up at 7am. For all those keeping score, that's the latest I have woken up so far on this trip. And not a moment too soon either, because I had a train to catch. I hit up the Happy Lamb one more time for some dumplings, bread, and noodles, then I was off to the train station.
I first rode the Shenzhen subway from Luohu District to Shenzhen North Railway Station. Though I had seen pictures and videos of Chinese railway stations, I don't think I was fully ready to comprehend the vastness of my first one in person. These structures are more akin to airports than train stations, at least in the American sense. Shenzhen North Station is the largest in Shenzhen and connects seamlessly to multiple subway lines. It also has arrivals and departures levels for auto transport, similar to what you might see at an airport in the United States. Chinese Railways, the operator of all rail in the PRC, has built many of these new, massive stations outside of the centers of major cities, like Shenzhen. This is another way in which they act like airports. Many of the stations are at the end of subway lines and were built in areas where there was room to build ramps for automobiles and buses. Most major cities also have an older, usually smaller, city-center station, but these stations see fewer intercity rail trips than their suburban peers.
Shenzhen North has a wavy ceiling design that seems to flow above the chaotic sea of people for a mile. I got in line for security and ticket check. Yes, in China there is airport-style security at the train stations, just like the subways, albeit less thorough (this will become more apparent in later posts). Security was a breeze even after they checked my multi-tool and determined the knife was small enough for their standards. For the ticket check, all you need to do is scan your passport or, if you are Chinese, your ID card. The ticket you purchased is linked to your ID, so no need for a physical or digital ticket. At Shenzhen North, most of the ticket check stations had scanners for both passports and IDs. Despite my initial fears, the process was a breeze and I made it to my gate with plenty of time before departure. There is another ticket check at the gate before the descent to the platform. Platform after platform stretched to my left and right. I got some photos of the other trains while waiting for mine. The Chinese Railway app, Railway 12306, indicates your carriage and seat number on your order, so it was easy to find my seat and enjoy the super-smooth ride to Guangzhou. This was a short ride with a few intermediate stops, and 50 minutes later I was in a new city. This station was Guangzhou East and, like most other intercity rail stations in China, it has a subway connection. The Alipay transportation function allowed me to switch from using a Shenzhen QR code to a Guangzhou QR code to pay for the subway, and I hopped on Line 1 to Xiamenkou Station.
Walking up from the subway to the street led me to immediately understand the differences between where I was staying in Guangzhou and Shenzhen. The roads were less wide and more chaotic. The commercial scene was far more informal, and shops were selling items for which it was difficult for me to understand the purpose. Along the way to my next hostel, the Lazy Gaga (Gaga means home in Cantonese), I saw vendors selling fake money, trinkets with Chinese inscriptions on them, and of course, statues and portraits of Chairman Mao. I later learned from a Chinese friend I met that these are part of traditions to honor ancestors. These items are placed at grave sites or at temples as an offering of respect and remembrance. At the time, I was ignorant and thought many of these shop owners were ripping off grannies by selling them fake money.
Unlike the first two hostels I had stayed at, this one better fit my idea of what a hostel ought to be. There was a restaurant serving local beers on the first floor and a common area to work or relax. Soft music was playing and the presence of other foreigners was apparent. I checked in and scoped out my dorm room, which to my delight had large lockers. Upon doing a little reconnaissance on the nearby streets, including grabbing some lunch, I decided to book two more nights at the hostel. I had yet to fully book for the three nights I was staying in Guangzhou, as I was worried about the condition of the hostel (Hostelworld had it rated at 7.8, just below my 8.0 threshold). The hostel had some negatives, mostly the bathrooms, but I felt like the ambiance and security were enough for me. Additionally, there was another factor at play: Sasa the hostel dog. Sasa is an absolute chonker of a Bichon Frise, and signs were posted throughout the hostel pleading with patrons not to feed her extra food. Some of the songs playing in the common area's playlist were created by the owner. The musical story was about how fat Sasa is and how she would commonly steal people’s food and beg for more. How could I resist hanging out with Sasa for a few more nights?
After settling in, I gallivanted around Beijing Road, one of the main commercial centers of Guangzhou. I stopped along the way at a few temples, including a large Buddhist site from the 1300s. Beijing Road has many pedestrianized sections, similar to Dongmen Market in Shenzhen, but in my opinion was more beautiful. Ficus trees hung with traditional lanterns arched over the crowds who were looking for everything from clothes, to food, to chinchillas (yes, there was a store solely dedicated to chinchillas). I stopped by a cat café and peered through the window, amazed by how well-behaved all these large, specially bred cats were. No cat in my life has ever voluntarily snuggled with other cats in a large group.
I continued my exploring and walked over to the Guangzhou Uprising Memorial. After going to temples and historic sites focusing on the Qing and Ming dynasties, I felt compelled to visit a more contemporary one. This was a free exhibit dedicated to the history of a particular battle between the Communist groups and the Nationalist army in 1927. After Chiang Kai-shek had violently ended the First United Front—an alliance between the Chinese Nationalist and Communist parties—the Communists were fractured, being defeated by the Kuomintang (KMT) in two other uprisings: Nanchang and Autumn Harvest. The mass arrests and executions by the KMT led trade unionists and the peasant class to violently attack the KMT in Guangzhou, long a bastion of revolution as the birthplace of Sun Yat-sen, China's George Washington figure. Communist groups led by Zhang Teilei organized, with the approval of the Soviet Union, to take the city. The uprising, like the earlier ones, failed. After the Communists briefly controlled Guangzhou, the KMT used the might of their more centralized military to end the uprising and execute the majority of associates. This was the last of the post-KMT uprisings and led the CCP to focus on rural support from peasants rather than in cities. It was unique to see the Communist Party's propaganda on full display in memorializing their controversial efforts.
I walked back to my hostel and looked over a list of “food to try” from my friend Danny, who had been to Guangzhou with his spouse in the past few years. I found a restaurant close by that made congee, a Cantonese dish. Congee is a rice porridge, usually with fish or meat. Though savory porridge does not honestly sound that appealing, I found it affordable and tasty. After the main course, I walked back to Beijing Road to try a dessert called double skin milk. It reminded me of an egg custard, but had more dairy flavor and was less sugary.
The long day of travel and exploration was over, and I walked back to my hostel to immediately fall asleep at 9pm.</p>

             <section id="day7">
                <h2>Day 7 – Guangzhou</h2>
                <p>It's another early start to the day to get to Baiyun Mountain, a large, hilly park complex that stretches from the central area of Guangzhou to its northern extent. My goal was to get sunrise, or almost sunrise, views of the Guangzhou skyline from the mountain's many viewpoints.
The temperature was cool and the skies were clear as I walked out of the Lazy Gaga into the night air. I first tried to take a bus that would have dropped me off right at the south entrance to the park, but unfortunately the bus transportation QR code would not work with my Alipay. It would take me too long to learn that in situations like this, all one needs to do is scan the regular Alipay or Weixin QR code to pay the fare. Out of luck with the bus, I rode the subway, which was a bit more out of the way to the entrance.
Per usual for China, there were plenty of small shops and street vendors selling food for breakfast. I picked up some sweetbreads and water, then started my walk up to the top of Baiyun. There was a small entry fee (5 yuan), but the expansive park was well worth the charge. I walked up a steeper pathway to see a few temples and tombs. The mountain was full of historical sites with really nice interpretive signs. The temperature, already balmy, continued to increase with the sun's presence, as did the haze of the city, which reduced visibility of the skyline. Getting to a few viewpoints, I was still able to take some nice pictures of the mountain and some of the iconic towers of Guangzhou, though getting to the mountain a bit earlier would have made for some better pics. On the summit of Baiyun, I observed some other individuals and groups enjoying the sunshine. I took the opportunity to sit in a little wooded nook near the summit to listen and watch the birds flit around in the trees and rustle in the leaves.
My phone battery had reached the point where I was starting to feel uncomfortable, so I hustled down the mountain to the closest subway station. This is one issue with having everything in the PRC tethered to phone apps. However, one solution is portable charging banks for rent. These small rental kiosks are everywhere and are fairly affordable—usually 3 yuan for an hour of charging. The banks can be returned to any of the kiosks that match the provider, so there is no annoying issue of having to stay around the kiosk from which the charger was rented. Luckily, I made it to the subway with enough charge to pay my fare and get all the way back to my hostel.
At the hostel, I rested and did some writing, listening to the mixtape playing over the common room speakers. 
Extremely hungry from an active morning, I got some local lunch: noodles with a wonderful umami broth and pieces of beef. This restaurant I went to is just down the road from the hostel, and the first experience would bring me back later in the week.
From lunch, I walked to the beautiful Temple of the Six Banyan Trees. The temple has been in Guangzhou since 537 AD, being rebuilt several times, the latest being 1373. Since then, it has survived multiple wars, including the Japanese occupation of Guangzhou. The pagoda towers above the surrounding neighborhood, serving as a familiar landmark by which to orient oneself. Similar to other temples I visited on the trip, the complex was full of visitors paying their respects, lighting candles, and giving offerings of food and cash. However, the mood seemed more reserved at Six Banyans. Maybe it was the beauty of the pagoda and the surrounding shaded courtyard, which contains the namesake trees. Maybe there is a certain reverence to this temple that I failed to recognize. Either way, the temples and pagoda were beautiful and well deserving of the quiet peace which was commanded, as were the surrounding neighborhoods. I was particularly fond of an alleyway with murals depicting the journey of an early Chinese philosopher in a cartoon-like art medium. There was even a sign showing the process of restoring the alley and creating the artwork.
Continuing my temple run, I took a short walk over to the Guangxiao Temple, just a few blocks away from Six Banyans. The Buddhist complex is one of the oldest temples in Guangzhou, dating from 233 AD, but rebuilt and renovated several times over the centuries. The oldest structure that has lasted without being rebuilt is a small pagoda sitting under a banyan tree. The Yifa Pagoda dates back to 676 AD and is one of five pagodas from the Tang Dynasty remaining in Guangdong province. Throughout the temple, people were offering flowers at altars instead of the usual food and yuan. Many were using the opportunity of a sky-blue day and the flowers to do some photoshoots for their engagements or what seemed to be for social media. It made for a less reverent atmosphere than at Six Banyan Trees, but was an interesting display of behavior that is not as common in the United States. One would be hard-pressed to see hundreds of individuals dressed in costume or dress taking professional pictures at Old North Church in Boston. Maybe the lighting just isn't as good…
Back at the hostel, I was determined to try another local delicacy that was recommended to me: clay pot rice. Like the name of the dish indicates, rice, meat, and vegetables are cooked and served in a medium-sized clay pot. I actually used online ratings to choose a restaurant, something I had not done much at all during the trip so far.
Arriving at the restaurant, I was nervous because of course it was… POPULAR! I usually avoid super busy restaurants because my lack of Chinese language abilities makes the decision-making process feel rushed. This time, I didn't let my nerves get the best of me, and I strolled into a newly opened table. The table app failed to work on my phone, so I went to the counter area and ordered once a worker came over to assist me. What I pointed at ended up being clay pot rice with frog legs. Not my first choice, but an interesting experience. The high bone-to-meat ratio makes eating frog a little cumbersome along with rice and vegetables.
As I started getting to the bottom of the pot, I noticed a crust of partly burned rice was still attached to the clay vessel. I wondered, “is this something I eat?” I looked around sheepishly, seeing if anyone else was chowing down on rice crust, and didn't see any evidence. I was still hungry, though, and decided to scrape off the rice and eat it like rice chips with my chopsticks. My hunger ended up having the right intuition, as I later read the crust is, for many, the best part! It goes to show that trying new food should be done based on how one feels in the moment. This time, I looked like I kind of knew what I was doing, and if I had eaten it the wrong way, it would have at least made for a funny video on Chinese social media.
A week down! How the time flies.</p>
