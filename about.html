        <h1>About the Trip</h1>
        <p>
            Hello friends, family, and randos. It's Alex (not Joao) and I'm traveling around China and southeast
            Asia for 3 months. My goal is to finish the trip on Komodo Island, a place I have dreamed
            of visting since childhood (thanks to the episode "Steve and the Dragon" on The Crocodile Hunter).

            I will be posting somewhat daily musings and photos. While there won't be a true focus to the
            blog, there will be a heavy dose of transportation (choo-choo), land use, and cultural subjects.
        </p>

        <h1>No Planes (Edna Mode Voice)</h1>
        <p>
           Other than flying to and from the United States, I will be doing my best to refrain from using
           planes during my travels. Trains, buses, ferries, and automobiles only! While this may seem impractical,
           I firmly believe that ground and water transport is a better way to see the place you are visiting while
           meeting more folks along the way.
